## Project Overview

A comprehensive weather analytics dashboard that aggregates data from multiple sources to provide detailed weather insights, historical analysis, and basic forecasting capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Multi-source Data Aggregation**: Combines data from OpenWeather API and historical datasets
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic charts and graphs using D3.js
- **Historical Analysis**: Compare current conditions with historical patterns
- **Location-based Insights**: Weather data for multiple geographical locations
- **Export Functionality**: Download charts and data in various formats
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python with Flask framework
- **Database**: SQLite for local data storage
- **Visualization**: D3.js for interactive charts
- **APIs**: OpenWeather API for real-time data
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with modern ES6+ features
- **Styling**: CSS3 with Flexbox and Grid layouts

## Data Processing Pipeline

### Data Collection
Automated scripts collect weather data every hour from the OpenWeather API and store it in a normalized SQLite database structure.

### Data Analysis
Python scripts analyze patterns, calculate trends, and generate insights from the collected data using pandas and numpy.

### Visualization Pipeline
D3.js creates dynamic, interactive visualizations that update in real-time as new data becomes available.

## Technical Challenges

### Challenge 1: API Rate Limiting
Implemented intelligent caching and batch processing to work within API rate limits while ensuring data freshness.

### Challenge 2: Data Visualization Performance
Optimized D3.js rendering for large datasets using data aggregation and lazy loading techniques.

## Skills Developed

- API integration and data pipeline development
- Advanced data visualization with D3.js
- Time series data analysis
- RESTful API design with Flask
- Performance optimization for data-heavy applications
