## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Real-time Inventory Management
Implementing real-time inventory updates across multiple user sessions was complex. I solved this using WebSocket connections and MongoDB change streams to notify clients of inventory changes instantly.

### Challenge 2: Payment Security
Ensuring secure payment processing while maintaining good UX. I implemented Stripe's Payment Intent API with proper error handling and secure token management.

## What I Learned

- Advanced React patterns and state management
- RESTful API design and implementation
