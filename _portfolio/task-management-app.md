## Project Overview

A collaborative task management application designed for teams to organize, track, and complete projects efficiently. Features real-time collaboration, drag-and-drop interfaces, and comprehensive project analytics.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Live updates when team members make changes
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Intuitive Kanban-style boards
- **Project Analytics**: Visual reports and progress tracking
- **Team Management**: Role-based permissions and team organization
- **Notifications**: Real-time notifications for task updates
- **Time Tracking**: Built-in time tracking for productivity analysis

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3 with Composition API
- **Backend**: Django REST Framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data persistence
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and caching
- **Real-time**: WebSockets with Django Channels
- **Styling**: Vuetify for Material Design components

## Architecture Highlights

### Real-time Updates
Implemented WebSocket connections using Django Channels to provide instant updates when tasks are created, modified, or moved between columns.

### Optimistic UI Updates
Used optimistic updates on the frontend to provide immediate feedback while API calls are in progress, with rollback functionality for failed operations.

### Caching Strategy
Implemented Redis caching for frequently accessed data like user permissions and project metadata to improve response times.

## Learning Outcomes

- Advanced Vue.js patterns and reactive programming
- WebSocket implementation for real-time features
- Django REST Framework best practices
- Database optimization and query performance
- Caching strategies and implementation
