# Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning: A Survey

## Introduction

This post reviews the survey on Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, which enable adaptation of large pre-trained models with minimal computational resources and parameter updates.

## Key Topics Covered

- Introduction to Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning
- LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
- Adapter Methods
- Prefix Tuning and P-Tuning
- BitFit and Other Sparse Methods
- Comparison of PEFT Techniques
- Performance vs Efficiency Trade-offs
- Applications and Use Cases
- Future Research Directions
